In this exmaple, there will be two binaries under /tmp/i686/rpc folder named
loop1 and loop2, which iterately prints out running messages. The container
itself is started in passive mode(rpc mode), which will open tcp port for
receiving rpc request, i.e executing commands remotely. We will run two
binaries through this way, and you might check the output of these binaries
under folder /tmp/i686/rpc/log.

Additionaly, you might want to know other rpc subcommands, please visit this
