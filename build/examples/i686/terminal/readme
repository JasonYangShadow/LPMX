In this exmaple, there will be a binary under bin folder named pid, which
prints out the pid of current running process. However, through employing elf
patcher technology, we have developed a fake getpid function and modified elf
header section of the binary named pid, resulting in loading fake getpid function we
developed. 

Additionaly, you will find that you could do any thing inside the bash
interaction terminal environment, such as create file, delete file and etc.
However, you can't do anything outside the root folder of current container,
that is /tmp/i686/terminal, any operations executed outside the container
will be intercepted and blocked. But you could change the privilges
dynanmically without restart container. For details please check the tutorial
