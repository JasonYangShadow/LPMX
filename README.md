# LPMX 
lpmx is rootless container other than local package manager. 
It employs the LD_PRELOAD mechanism and ELF header patch to implement both elf modification and system calls interception.

Therefore, this project contains customized [fakechroot](https://github.com/JasonYangShadow/fakechroot) and [elfpatcher](https://github.com/JasonYangShadow/patchelf). 

## Attention: Current LPMX is not in release channel.

# Compile from source code 
1. Make sure golang is installed on your os
2. go get -v github.com/jasonyangshadow/lpmx
3. cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/jasonyangshadow/lpmx
4. ./build.sh
5. you will find everything under folder build

If there are any dependencies issues, try to install gilde and execute 'glide update' inside project folder

# Quick run
1. Download binary from [https://github.com/JasonYangShadow/lpmx/blob/master/build/linux/x86_64/lpmx](https://github.com/JasonYangShadow/lpmx/blob/master/build/linux/x86_64/lpmx) to local folder
2. chmod a+x lpmx && ./lpmx init

# How to use it
1. lpmx init  -> initialize the basic system folder for lpmx ( otherwize, any commands executed following will report error and notify you should execute initialize command firstly)
2. As LPMX supports docker images, one can search, download and create containers based on docker images.  
> lpmx docker search NAME  
> lpmx docker download NAME:TAG  
> lpmx docker create NAME:TAG  

For creating containers based on cutomized content:  
1. lpmx run -c config_file_path -s target_container_root_folder -> creates and starts running container based on configuration file and target folder via terminal. 
2. lpmx run -c config_file_path -s target_container_root_folder -p -> creates and starts running container in passive mode, which will result in opening rpc port to receive commands and no interaction terminal is triggered.

**NOTE**: users can always resume exited container by 'lpmx resume' command. For the id of container, users can always use 'lpmx list' command to show info of all registered containers.  

### lpmx list command is used for listing the information of all the registered containers, including containerid, container rpc port(NA for no rpc port)
```
list command is the basic command of lpmx, which is used for listing all the containers registered

Usage:
  lpmx list [flags]

Flags:
  -h, --help   help for list
```

### lpmx resume command is used for resuming stopped container, you need to use this command with containerid argument
```
Usage:
  lpmx resume [flags]

Flags:
  -h, --help   help for resume

Example:
  ./lpmx resume containerid
```

### lpmx run command is used for creating and running conatiner, you need to define the configuration file and target source folder 
```

  kill        kill the commands executed remotely via pid
  query       query the information of commands executed remotely

Flags:
  -h, --help   help for rpc

Use "lpmx rpc [command] --help" for more information about a command.

Example:
  Firstly make sure that your container should be ran under passive mode, i.e, container is started with -p flag.


  rpc exec sub-command is the advanced comand of lpmx, which is used for executing command remotely through rpc
  Usage:
    lpmx rpc exec [flags]

  Flags:
    -h, --help             help for exec
    -i, --ip string        required
    -p, --port string      required
    -t, --timeout string   optional

  ./lpmx rpc exec -i ipaddress(localhost) -p rpc port(you can get it througth './lpmx list' command) -t timeout for command 


  rpc query sub-command is the advanced comand of lpmx, which is used for querying the information of commands executed remotely through rpc                                                   Usage:
    lpmx rpc query [flags]

  Flags:
   -h, --help          help for query
   -i, --ip string     required
   -p, --port string   required

 ./lpmx rpc query -i ipadress -p rpc port

  rpc delete sub-command is the advanced comand of lpmx, which is used for killing the commands executed remotely through rpc via pid                                                          Usage:
    lpmx rpc kill [flags]

    -h, --help          help for kill
    -i, --ip string     required
    -d, --pid string    required
    -p, --port string   required
  ./lpmx rpc kill -i ipadress -p rpc port -d pid(you can get it through '.lpmx rpc query -i ipaddress -p rpc port')
```

### lpmx set command is used for setting environment variables for containers dynamically
```
set command is an additional comand of lpmx, which is used for setting environment variables of running containers                                                                                                              
Usage:
  lpmx set [flags]

Flags:
  -h, --help           help for set
  -i, --id string      required(container id, you can get the id by command 'lpmx list')
  -n, --name string    required(put 'user' for operation change_user)
  -t, --type string    required('add_needed', 'remove_needed', 'add_rpath', 'remove_rpath', 'change_user', 'add_privilege', 'remove_privilege')

  Exception:
   for setting users, i.e, normal user or root user inside container, firslty you need to stop container and then execute 'lpmx set' command
   ./lpmx set -i conatainerid -t change_user -n user -v defalut/root
``` 

### lpmx destroy command is used for destroying container, i.e deleting configuration files
```
destroy command is the basic command of lpmx, which is used for destroying the registered container via id

  -h, --help   help for destroy

Example:
  ./lpmx destroy containerid
```

### About YAML configuration file
```
lpmx receive yml configuration file while creating containers

some configurations can be put in as your requirements:

1. add_needed -> used for patching binaries elf header with needed libraries

Format:
xxx.yml

add_needed:
  - program A
    - needed A
    - needed B
    - ...

2. add_rpath -> used for patching binaries elf header with rpaths 

Format:
xxx.yml

add_rpath:
  - prgram A 
    - rpath A
    - rpath B
    - ...
  - Folder A
    - rpath A
    - rpath B
    - ...

3. default_user -> used for changing default user inside container

Format:
xxx.yml

default_user: root

4. allow_list -> used for setting privilges during intializing stage

Format: xxx.yml allow_list:
  - program A : privilege_allow_folder
  - program B : privilege_allow_folder
```
**NOTE** users may not need to modify configuration files themselves in principle unless they clearly know what they want. Most items in configuration file are set and configurated by LPMX itself, any new value will overrite default one. Therefore, if any errors occur after modification, please empty configuration file and recreate containers.
