# LPMX 
lpmx is rootless container other than local package manager. 
It employs the LD_PRELOAD mechanism and ELF header patch to implement both elf modification and system calls interception.

Therefore, this project contains customized [fakechroot](https://github.com/JasonYangShadow/fakechroot) and [elfpatcher](https://github.com/JasonYangShadow/patchelf). 

# Compile from source code 
1. Make sure golang is installed on your os
2. go get -v github.com/jasonyangshadow/lpmx
3. cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/jasonyangshadow/lpmx
4. ./build.sh
5. you will find everything under folder build

If there are any dependencies issues, try to install gilde and execute 'glide update' inside project folder

# Quick run
1. make sure that you have wget installed on your os
2. wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JasonYangShadow/lpmx/master/install.sh; chmod +x install.sh; ./install.sh
3. you will find a folder named lpmx in your current directory containing
   necessary files and dependencies, also examples are included
4. if you run examples, target folder will be created under tmp folder


# How to use it
1. lpmx init  -> initialize the basic system folder for lpmx ( otherwize, any commands executed following will report error and notify you should execute initialize command firstly)
2. lpmx run -c config_file_path -s target_container_root_folder -> creates and starts running container based on configuration file and target folder via terminal. 
3. lpmx run -c config_file_path -s target_container_root_folder -p -> creates and starts running container in passive mode, which will result in opening rpc port to receive commands and no interaction terminal is triggered.

Flags:
  -h, --help   help for rpc

Use "lpmx rpc [command] --help" for more information about a command.

Example:
  Firstly make sure that your container should be ran under passive mode, i.e, container is started with -p flag.
